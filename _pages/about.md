Hello!
I graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My background focuses on mechanical design for robotics and mechanical devices, but Iâ€™m also working to expand my skillset in areas like programming, electronic controls, and sensing for robotic systems.

This portfolio highlights my work in mechanical design and robotics
